Python File I/O Learning Module

This module covers Python's file handling through practical test examples:
- Basic File Operations
  * Opening and closing files
  * Reading files (read, readline, readlines)
  * Writing files (write, writelines)
  * File modes (r, w, a, b, +)
- File System Operations
  * os module for file operations
  * pathlib for modern path handling
  * Directory operations
  * File metadata
- Working with Paths
  * Absolute vs relative paths
  * Path manipulation
  * Path existence and permissions
- Text vs Binary Files
  * Text file handling
  * Binary file operations
  * Encoding and decoding
- Data Serialization
  * JSON reading/writing
  * CSV handling
  * Pickle for Python objects
- Best Practices
  * Context managers for files
  * Error handling
  * Performance considerations
  * Platform independence

Each test demonstrates a specific concept with practical examples.
