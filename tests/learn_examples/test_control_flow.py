Python Control Flow Learning Module

This module covers Python's control flow statements through practical test examples:
- Conditional Statements
  * if, elif, else
  * Nested conditionals
  * Conditional expressions (ternary operators)
- Loops
  * for loops with range()
  * for loops with iterables
  * while loops
  * Nested loops
- Control Statements
  * break - exit the loop
  * continue - skip to next iteration
  * pass - do nothing placeholder
- Loop Else Clause
  * Using else with for loops
  * Using else with while loops
- Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)
  * Basic match-case statements
  * Pattern matching with sequences
  * Pattern matching with mappings

Each test demonstrates a specific concept with practical examples.
