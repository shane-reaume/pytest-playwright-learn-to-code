Python Data Types Learning Module

This module covers Python's built-in data types through practical test examples:
- Numbers (int, float)
- Strings and string methods
- Booleans and logical operations
- Type conversions (casting)
- String formatting (f-strings, .format(), %-formatting)
- Using type() and id() for type inspection
- None type and its usage

Each test demonstrates a specific concept with practical examples.
